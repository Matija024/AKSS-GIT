Nowadays, there is a great demand to outsource parts of systems. The term for digital outsourcing is cloud computing. With the advantages of cloud computing come new vulnerabilities. Outsourcing increases the attack surface and companies have already developed many concepts to prevent attacks. Intel created its own Trusted Execution Environment, called Software Guard Extension, where save memory areas are deployed to, e.g., execute certain program sections. However, Software Guard Extension is still vulnerable to certain attacks.\\
In this paper, we look into forking attacks and two extensions that take different approaches to create an environment robust against forking attacks. These extensions have their own approaches with different requirements, dependencies, and complexity. These approaches are analyzed to create added value that increases the reliability of cloud computing.

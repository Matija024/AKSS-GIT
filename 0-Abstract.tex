Nowadays, there is a great demand to outsource parts of systems. The term for digital outsourcing is cloud computing. With the advantages of cloud computing come new vulnerabilities. Outsourcing increases the attack surface and companies have already developed many concepts to prevent attacks. Intel, for example, implemented Software Guard Extension (SGX) to increase the security of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). However, SGX is also vulnerable to attacks.\\
In this paper, we look into forking attacks and two extensions that take different approaches to create an environment robust against forking attacks. The extensions have their own approaches which of course have different requirements, dependencies, and complexity. These approaches are analyzed and compared to identify possible applications and create added value that increases the reliability of cloud computing.

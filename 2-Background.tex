The concepts which are discussed in this paper, will be explained further to provied an comprenhensive knowledge beforhand.

\subsection{Trusted Execution Environment, TEE}

TEEs aim to increae the saveness of data and exacerbate the tempering with crucial code sections, by allowing the processor to have protection through different implementations 
like Intels SGX enclave system. 

\subsection{Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks}

\subsection{Liveness}

\subsection{Safety}
